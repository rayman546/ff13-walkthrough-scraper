This will\n\ngive you some of the intel each time you cast it on an enemy, but it will\n\noften take multiple casts to get it all.

For me, this meant buying 3 things at a cost of 9,000 Gil.\n\nSo far, if you've followed my guide, you've upgraded exactly zero of these, so\n\nwe're going to assume that we're starting from square one.  The general formula\n\nfor upgrading this is 6 Superconductors and 1 Perovskite, which will get you to\n\nyour next level.  You'll need to repeat this 12 times to get one of each, then\n\n4 more times to upgrade your Pain Dampeners and White Capes.  Each upgrade will\n\ncost you 35,040, so this section will ding you for 560,640.\n\nBefore we move on, let's prepare ourselves for one of our upcoming battles.\n\nTake one of your new Pain Deflectors and add 36 Sturdy Bones and 9\n\nSuperconductors, taking it to * level.  Repeat with your other two Pain\n\nDeflectors, then repeat again with your 3 Effulgent Capes.  Total Cost for this", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T01:01:27.751411"}

You'll have to dodge a bunch of dogs to get to the stone.  The\n\nmission itself is on the mesa back by the turtles, so grab a chocobo to save\n\nsome time.\n\nThe mission itself is very challenging, and can be very frustrating if you try\n\nto overpower him.  The strategy that we'll be using should make this a really\n\nboring battle, which is probably a good thing if you're ready to move on to the\n\nnext game like I am.  I can't take credit for the strategy:  it's all Auron402,\n\nand after 4 or 5 successful and easy battles I've never seen a need to alter\n\nit.\n\nRemember all those Pain Deflectors and Effulgent Capes we maxed out back in the\n\nAccessories section?

This will mostly kill you,\n\nremove a buff or two, and inflict Daze so you can't move.  Unfortunately, their\n\nrare drop is the Dark Matter, and we need a few of these, so we're going to\n\nhave to fight quite a few before we're done.  The battles are hard, but it's\n\nstill easier than getting 840,000 Gil to buy each Dark Matter.\n\nThe basic strategy I used for these guys came from a YouTube video by\n\nPazuzoo360PSN, so thank you for the video and the strategy.  I've simplified\n\nthings a little, but the basic strategy works well enough to get you through\n\nthe game.  First, I chose a Moonbow Anklet for Fang over the Sprint Shoes, just\n\nbecause I really hate Daze and we'll have plenty of time to put Haste on later.\n\nTheoretically, you could make more of these for each character if you want, but", "timestamp": "2025-08-25T01:01:28.408306"}
